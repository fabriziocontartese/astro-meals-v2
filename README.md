## ðŸ“… Next steps

0. **Profile UI:** buy VS Copilot

1. **Correct Profile page:** should not start as edit, should not lose the activity level and water intake, remove recompute (auto after edit should work properly)

2. **Correct NavBar errors:** the redirections don't work from every page to every page

3. **Complete Profile Supabase:** the profile should be able to gather all the data on the drive report Google Docs

4. **Profile UI:** display all relevant info in a clear way on the Profile page, improving copy and including (info) buttons for what's not clear

5. **Start working on the recipes:** ingredients are the base, then nutrients, then recipes/* (pizza, sushi, etc.)

6. **Plan Supabase:** include calendar, how many meals per day and at what time, 

7. **Plan UI:** creating plan creates custom drag&drop calendar for the meals, export function
